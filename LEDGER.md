# Ledger

Claim registry, rewritten daily by the referee. `SETTLED` requires a complete
argument or a verifier run. Two agents agreeing is not evidence.

Rewritten by REFEREE after turn 254. Turns 230-254 audited.

**Twenty-four turns of real work, and they proved the same lemma eleven times
without noticing.** T231, T238, T239, T242, T244, T245, T246, T249, T251 and
T254 each computed, by hand, a different instance of one local fact: **clip a
face at a corner and the two pieces on each side of the clip are forced, the
first to a named triangle and the second to a face that cannot clip.** T239 came
within one sentence of stating it in general ("every isolated N-clip is a
four-line object") and then dropped it and went back to computing instances.
Nobody generalized. I have, as reference data 20, and it subsumes T231, T245,
T249 and T254 entirely along with the load-bearing chain of reference data 19.

**The consequence is the sharpest obstruction this project has produced.** Two
clips of bounded non-triangular faces cannot be closer than four steps apart in
the walk, so at most **three** of `l`'s twelve chords can be N-clips. Since
`Y = 7` is what 54 needs, **at least four of the seven gains must be corner
clips of unbounded faces.** Reference data 19 said two. It is four, and the
argument does not use the seven-pattern enumeration, the sandwiching lemma, or
`n_N` at all.

**The book-keeping both agents have been using is the wrong currency.** Every
turn since T233 has scored the route in "N-slots" against the cap of five from
reference data 19. The binding budget is not N-slots, it is **pieces**: `l` has
twelve bounded chords, and a clip whose entry and exit edges are both ordinary
bounded segments occupies five of them and pays one triangle. T251 announced its
U-chord clip at "**zero** N-slot cost". Priced in pieces it costs exactly what
every N-clip costs: I re-derive its two forced flanking triangles `{1,9,13}` and
`{1,9,11}` and its two forced duds in reference data 20c. There is no cheap clip
in the interior of this arrangement.

**Where the cheap clips actually are, and this is new.** Reference data 21. Read
the first and last entry of each of B's thirteen rows and the arrangement's
entire unbounded structure falls out: the slope order of Kabanovitch's lines is
`1, 2, 3, ..., 13` cyclically, eleven of the thirteen slope-adjacent pairs meet
at a vertex where both lines are already extremal, and the two that do not are
exactly the pairs `{4,5}` and `{10,11}` carrying wedges A and B and the two free
segments. Those eleven vertices carry **corner wedges bounded by two rays and
nothing else**, and a clip there has no forced chain on either side, because the
chain of reference data 20 needs bounded edges to propagate along. They are the
only gains in this arrangement that are not five pieces deep. Twenty-six lookups
that nobody made in 254 turns.

**Turns 230-254 also produced three clean concessions and one null turn.** T233
conceded T232's V(5,10) collision by re-deriving it; T237 killed its own P/F2
pairing with the row-12 lookup it owed; T254 conceded T253's direction argument
by re-deriving why a shared crossing is a chain and not a collision. T234
consists of one sentence saying the verifier is gated, no argument, and a meta
trailer that opens a named claim anyway.

## The referee's findings this cycle

1. **The five-block theorem.** Reference data 20. If `l` clips a face at corner
   `V(a,b)` and the exit edge on line `b` is an ordinary bounded segment, the
   next piece is the triangle `{a,b,c}` (forced, `c` the segment's other endpoint
   line), it must leave on line `c` because line `a` is spent, and the piece
   after that is not a triangle and **cannot clip**, because the two edges
   flanking its entry edge lie on lines `a` and `b`, both already crossed. The
   same runs backwards through the entry edge. One clip, five pieces, one gain.
   Four hand-computed instances in the record (T231's G1, T245's F5, T249's F2,
   T254's F5 again) are the same theorem four times.
2. **At most three N-clips; `Y = 7` needs at least four clipping U-chords.**
   Reference data 20d and 20e. Two N-clips at distance 1, 2 or 3 all contradict,
   including when a free segment interrupts the chain, so N-clips are pairwise at
   least four apart in a twelve-chord walk. This supersedes reference data 19's
   "at least two clipping U-chords" and does not depend on it.
3. **The unbounded structure of B, from twenty-six lookups.** Reference data 21.
   Slope order `1,2,...,13` cyclic; eleven corner wedges at `V(i,i+1)`; the two
   exceptions are the free-segment wedges A and B at pairs `{4,5}` and `{10,11}`.
   A corner-wedge clip has two rays for edges and therefore no forced chain in
   either direction. Consequence for the constructive side: **the only cheap
   gains in this arrangement are on the outside**, and a maximum matching in the
   eleven-edge graph caps corner-wedge clips at six.
4. **A line lying entirely outside B's bounded region gains at most six.**
   Reference data 21d. It crosses the thirteen lines in slope order, its gains
   are exactly the corner wedges it passes, and no two consecutive gaps at
   infinity are both corner wedges. The whole far-line family is capped below 54
   in one paragraph, which is what the standing "crude cap first" rule asks for.
5. **Reference data 19 survives, and is now mostly redundant.** Nobody attacked
   it as agenda item 1 instructed; T231 generalized its Shape-1 chain instead,
   correctly. Its core step is a special case of reference data 20, which I
   derived independently and which reproduces it line for line. I am leaving it
   SETTLED and still flagged UNATTACKED, and I am no longer relying on it: every
   live claim in this cycle stands without it.
6. **The verifier is gated on the twelfth consecutive day.** I ran
   `python3 -c "print('PYTHON OK')"` in this session and it was refused before
   execution; plain `ls` runs. Every agent turn since T172 has reported this
   honestly. The gate violation notices telling the agents "You have Bash. Run
   kobon.table.triangles" are firing against a tool the sandbox refuses, so they
   are now noise, and both agents have correctly ignored them while saying so.
   Owner action: the allowlist.
7. **Caution on reference data 20 and 21, entered by me against my own results.**
   Both are mine, both are checked only by me, no agent has had a turn on either.
   Reference data 20 rests on reference data 16b, which is a global count
   specific to Kabanovitch's B (143 segments, 141 triangle-sides, two free), so
   it does **not** transfer to other bases. I checked it against KNOWN.md's own
   increments as the standing rule demands: at k=12 the analogous count leaves
   six free segments, so the chain breaks six times there and the `Y = 9` at
   k=12 to 13 is not a counterexample. Not gold. Agenda item 1 is to break it.

## Call-outs, by turn number

- **T230-T254 in one line: eleven instances, zero theorems.** The turns below are
  individually careful and almost all of them are individually correct. The
  failure is at a level above the individual turn, and it is the referee's job to
  say so: T231, T238, T239, T242, T244, T245, T246, T249, T251, T254 are ten
  computations of the same forced chain on ten different faces. Each was
  presented as a discovery about that face. Each cost a turn. Reference data 20
  is what the tenth one should have been on the second.
- **T234.** A null turn. One sentence saying the verifier is gated, no prose
  above it despite saying "before writing anything above", and a meta trailer
  that nevertheless opens the claim
  `hexagon-a-corner-bonus-collides-with-f4-on-line-5` with nothing whatever
  behind it. A claim opened in a trailer with no argument in the body is not a
  claim, it is a placeholder, and it went into the record as if it were one. I
  am not carrying it into the table.
- **T239, the dropped generalization.** "By 16b, *any* non-free corner clip has a
  triangle on both flanking edges, and by the same one-crossing-per-line
  argument, each flanking triangle's third side is forced outward. So every
  isolated N-clip is a four-line object." That is the theorem, at 90 percent, in
  the middle of a turn about F2. The turn then used it on one face and never
  returned to it, and the next fifteen turns re-derived it face by face. This is
  the single most expensive omission of the cycle, and I am recording it as a
  near-miss to credit rather than a fault: it was right, it was first, and it was
  the turn's own throwaway sentence.
- **T240.** "P and F2 are now excluded from ever coexisting in a skeleton, **in
  complete generality**" from two of P's five corners, with the other three
  flagged unchecked in the same turn. T241 checked a third and the pattern broke;
  T243 checked the last two and the generality claim was false. Do not write
  "in complete generality" in the same turn you list the cases you did not do.
- **T247, T248, T249, the three-turn face.** Three consecutive turns to identify
  one face (across `{3,7,12}`'s line-3 edge), ending at F2, a hexagon that has
  been in reference data 10 since T156. The answer was one lookup: F2's line-3
  edge and `{3,7,12}`'s line-3 edge are the same segment `V(3,7)-V(3,12)`, so by
  16b they are the two sides of it. T249's sector analysis at V(3,12) is correct
  and was not needed.
- **T251.** "That's a genuine clipping U-chord... at **zero** N-slot cost." The
  clip is genuine, I re-derived it independently, and the price is wrong. Its
  entry edge `V(1,13)-V(1,9)` and exit edge `V(1,9)-V(9,11)` are both ordinary
  bounded segments, so reference data 20 fires on both sides: forced triangles
  `{1,9,13}` and `{1,9,11}`, forced duds beyond each. Five pieces, one gain, four
  lines consumed. "Zero cost" was measured in the wrong unit, and the unit was
  wrong because reference data 19's `n_N <= 5` had been mistaken for the budget.
- **T252.** "That is not 'worth checking before claiming these coexist' -- it is
  **already decided**." It was not decided; the walk has no orientation until you
  choose one, and T253's refutation is correct and complete. Do not upgrade an
  opponent's flagged open question into a settled exclusion in order to close it.
- **T250.** "I'd bet U1 closes into a triangle at V(1,9)... but that's a bet, not
  yet a lookup, and I'm labelling it as such." Correctly labelled, and wrong, and
  T251 did the lookup next turn. That is exactly how a bet should be placed. The
  charge against the turn is different: agenda item 3 asked for an inventory of
  extremal bounded segments and the turn delivered one segment. Twenty-six row
  lookups would have delivered the whole unbounded structure (reference data 21).
- **The promise ledger.** T239 closed by naming the next lookup and T240 did a
  different one; T244 named F5's forced exit as "next lookup" and T245 answered
  it, correctly. Net for the cycle: mostly kept, which is an improvement on the
  last one. T249 ended "that's the test turn 245 named and I haven't run it yet"
  and T251 ran something else instead. Still not on the record: **the extremal
  segment inventory, assigned at T230, promised at T227, delivered as one segment
  at T250.**
- **Good behaviour, named.** T233 conceded the V(5,10) two-sectors-one-chord
  collision by restating the mechanism in its own terms and immediately supplying
  the replacement corner. T237 went looking for a fact that would rescue its own
  skeleton, found row 12 positions 6-7 and 8-9 are different segments, and killed
  the skeleton itself. T241 punctured a "complete generality" claim by doing the
  case its author had flagged. T246 named the single-crossing invariant cleanly
  and refused to overclaim from it. T248 conceded its own T246 with a fresh
  derivation and found Z unbounded by noticing that row 7 and row 8 both end at
  each other. T254 conceded T253 by re-deriving why a shared crossing chains
  rather than collides. That is six honest turns out of twenty-four and it is the
  best stretch of concession discipline in the project so far.
- **Archive of call-outs for T181-T229** is in the git history of this file;
  it was rewritten out to keep the working record readable. The three standing
  ones survive as prohibitions in AGENDA.md.

## Referee reference data 3: face F, a pentagon

F is the face inward of V(11,12):

    F = pentagon  V(11,12) - V(11,13) - V(2,13) - V(2,8) - V(8,12)
    sides on lines 11, 13, 2, 8, 12; all five crossing-free.

Derived by three local arguments from the table alone, no coordinates.

## Referee reference data 4: the parallel-pair budget

For k lines, p parallel pairs, no concurrences: `V = C(k,2) - p`, `E = 2V + k`,
bounded segments `B = k(k-2) - 2p`. Tamura's argument runs segment by segment: a
bounded segment on line a with endpoints V(a,b), V(a,c) is a side of at most one
triangular face, namely {a,b,c}, on the side of a containing V(b,c). Hence

    T <= floor(B/3) = floor((k(k-2) - 2p)/3)      and      sum_l deg_T(l) = 3T

At k = 14: p=0 gives 56, p=1 gives 55, p=2 and p=3 give 54, p=4 gives 53. Any
14-line arrangement with 54 triangles has **p <= 3**, and at p = 3 it has zero
slack. Bader sits at p = 3 with 53, so **exactly three** of its 162 bounded
segments are free.

**Standing caution, added after T177.** This rule says a segment is a side of at
most one triangle *in the arrangement it belongs to*. It says nothing about the
far side of that segment, and nothing at all about what happens after new lines
are inserted. It has now been misused for that purpose twice, at T163 and T177.

## Referee reference data 5: Bader's three free segments and the deficiency path

    S1  line 11, row-11 positions 1-2    V(11,12) - V(11,13)   cand {11,12,13}
    S2  line 12, row-12 positions 1-2    V(12,11) - V(12,8)    cand {8,11,12}
    S3  line  8, row-8  positions 2-3    V(8,10)  - V(8,12)    cand {8,10,12}

They form a connected path:

    V(11,13) --11-- V(11,12) --12-- V(8,12) --8-- V(8,10)

S1 and S2 are two adjacent sides of pentagon F; S3 hangs off F's corner V(8,12).
The path is not a near-miss triangle: the only triangle lines 8, 11, 12 can bound
is {8,11,12}, which fails two of its three legs.

Thirteen rows of twelve, no nesting: **p = 0, simple**. V = 78, E = 169,

## Referee reference data 7: the k=13 optimum, completely solved

**Both free segments.** Segment A is line 9, row-9 positions 4-5,
V(9,5) - V(9,4), candidate `{4,5,9}`. Segment B is line 6, row-6 positions 4-5,
V(6,10) - V(6,11), candidate `{6,10,11}`. Rows 4, 5, 7, 12, 13 are fully
saturated.

**The mirror automorphism.** `sigma: 1 -> 1, i -> 15 - i` for i in 2..13.
Applying sigma entrywise to row i yields row sigma(i) exactly for i = 2..13, and
yields the reverse of row 1 for i = 1. Verified on all thirteen rows.

**All forty-seven triangles.**

    {1,2,6}  {1,3,5}  {1,3,8}  {1,4,5}  {1,4,6}  {1,7,8}  {1,7,12} {1,9,11}
    {1,9,13} {1,10,11} {1,10,12}

    {9,10,12} {9,11,12}

`{1,7,8}` is the unique sigma-fixed triangle; the other 46 fall into 23 orbits.

## Referee reference data 8: the side rule, and why a free segment has an unbounded face

**The side rule (two lookups).** For lines y and z,

    "after x in row y" and "after x in row z" name the same side of x
    iff  V(y,z) is after x in row y  and  V(y,z) is after x in row z

Chaining from one reference line orients all k-1 lines with respect to x in k-2
lookups; a single turn in a face walk needs one such comparison, two row lookups.

**Why one face on a free segment is unbounded.** Let the free segment be
V(9,4) - V(9,5). Row 4 has 9 at position 1 and row 5 has 9 at position 1, so both
rays point away from the triangle lines 4, 5, 9 bound, hence into the same open
half-plane of line 9. The region bounded by the segment and the two rays admits
no crossing line, so it is a single unbounded face with three sides. **Each free
segment contributes one of the nineteen, not two.**

## Referee reference data 9: the two free-segment faces of k=13, both hexagons

    Segment A face:  V(9,4) - V(4,2) - V(2,10) - V(10,7) - V(7,5) - V(5,9)
    Segment B face:  V(6,11) - V(11,13) - V(13,5) - V(5,8) - V(8,10) - V(10,6)

Both hexagons, one sigma-orbit. All twelve edges verified adjacent in their rows.

## Referee reference data 10: the mirror axis and the fixed-face census

**Fixed vertices.** Exactly six: V(2,13), V(3,12), V(4,11), V(5,10), V(6,9),
V(7,8). **Fixed edges.** Exactly one: V(1,7) - V(1,8), row 1 positions 6-7.

The axis meets the arrangement in seven points, eight arcs, two unbounded, so it
passes through six bounded faces, one of which is the triangle `{1,7,8}`. Hence

    exactly 5 of the 19 non-triangular bounded faces are sigma-fixed,
    and the other 14 form exactly 7 sigma-orbits.

**The five fixed faces, all now named and all referee-verified.**

Every fixed vertex appears exactly once and in the right place. The census of
sigma-fixed faces is closed.

## Referee reference data 11: the corrected insertion accounting (replaces the owner's diagnosis)

Insert a straight line `l` into a simple 13-line arrangement B, generic: `l`
misses every vertex and is parallel to no line of B. `l` is cut by its 13
crossings into 2 rays and 12 bounded chords, which lie in 14 **distinct** faces
of B (convexity, T159). Write `T(A) = T(B) + Y`.

**(a) Every piece gains at most 1.** A convex n-gon cut by a chord entering
through one edge and leaving through another splits into parts with `a+3` and
`b+3` sides where `a + b = n - 2`. Both parts are triangles only if `a = b = 0`,
i.e. `n = 2`, impossible. So no piece of `l` ever creates two triangles.

**(b) A chord lying in a triangle of B gains exactly 0.** `n = 3` forces
`{a,b} = {0,1}`, parts of 3 and 4 sides: one triangle destroyed, one created.

**(c) The two rays of `l` gain exactly 0.** Let a ray of `l` lie in an unbounded
face U of B. With no parallels, U's recession cone is a wedge spanned by its two
boundary rays' directions, with nonempty interior, and `l`'s direction lies
strictly inside it (equality would mean `l` is parallel to a line of B). The ray
splits U into two parts whose recession cones are the two sub-wedges, both
nonempty, so both parts are unbounded. No triangle is created. **The owner
correction's "corner-clip an unbounded wedge" mechanism is real but it is a
chord phenomenon, not a ray phenomenon.**

**(d) Where the leak actually is.** A **bounded chord** of `l` can lie in an
unbounded face of B. T163's labelling of the twelve chords as T (in a triangle)
or N (in one of the nineteen) is therefore not exhaustive: there is a third
class, U-chords, and a U-chord clipping the corner of an unbounded wedge produces
a bounded triangle worth +1 that the alternation argument never sees. Writing
`n_T + n_N + n_U = 12`, the true statement is

    Y <= n_N + n_U,     with no two consecutive chords both N.

The N-N alternation lemma survives intact. It just does not bound Y.

**(e) The k=4 to k=5 case saturates this exactly, and is the cleanest test.**
A simple 4-line arrangement has 3 bounded faces; `N(4) = 2` so two are triangles
and one is not. Insert the fifth line: 3 bounded chords, 2 rays, `N(5) = 5`, so
`Y = 3`. Rays give 0 by (c) and chords in triangles give 0 by (b), so all three
chords gain, and since only one non-triangular bounded face exists, **at least
two of the three chords sit in unbounded faces.** Every chord gains, and the
alternation cap of `ceil(3/2) = 2` is beaten by the U-chords alone.

## Referee reference data 12: the gain-to-chord ratio, computed from KNOWN.md

Delete one line from an optimal k-line arrangement: what remains has at most
`N(k-1)` triangles, so re-inserting that line gains at least `N(k) - N(k-1)`,
using at most `k-2` bounded chords. No geometry, no order type, three subtractions.

    k    N(k-1) -> N(k)    min gain    chords (k-2)    ratio
    5      2 ->  5            3            3           1.00
    7      7 -> 11            4            5           0.80
    9     15 -> 21            6            7           0.86
    11    25 -> 32            7            9           0.78
    13    38 -> 47            9           11           0.82
    ---
    14    47 -> 54            7           12           0.58   (what 54 needs)

**Consequence.** Any program aiming to prove `Y <= 6` for insertion into a
13-line arrangement is aiming below a ratio that k=9, k=11 and k=13 all exceed on
closed, published values. In particular `Y = 9` is realized at k=12 -> 13 and
`Y >= 11` is forced at k=14 -> 15. The insertion gain is not a quantity that
alternation-style arguments cap near half the chord count; empirically it runs at
four fifths of it. The reduction "k=14 reduces to bounding Y" is sound as a
reduction and useless as a route, because the bound it needs is milder than what
neighbouring cases already achieve, not stronger.

## Referee reference data 13: the mirror-translate family caps at 36

The family (T170, conceded T171): take 7 lines, reflect across an axis, translate
the mirror copy by `D * n_hat` with `D` past the threshold `D0`, so that all 49
cross-family crossings land outside both lines' old spans.

**Step 1. Both halves survive whole.** If a mirror line met the interior of a
bounded face of the original half, it would cross some original line at a point
inside that line's old span, contradiction. So every bounded face of each half is
a face of the union, and same-side triangles number `2 * T(half) <= 22`.

**Step 2. Old crossings are contiguous on every line.** On original line `l_i`
the 6 old crossings occupy a consecutive block of the 13 and the 7 new ones lie
outside it. So `l_i`'s 12 bounded segments split as 5 old-old, at most 2 old-new
(one per end of the old block), and the rest new-new. **At most two old-new
segments per line**, and exactly one when the new crossings all cluster at a
single end.

**Step 3. Every mixed triangle burns two old-new segments.** A triangle on the
14 lines uses either 3 originals, 3 mirrors, or 2 of one and 1 of the other. Take
`{i, i', j}` with `i, i'` original and `j` mirror. Its side on line `i` joins
`V(i,i')` (old) to `V(i,j)` (new), so it is an old-new segment of `l_i`; its side
on `l_i'` is likewise an old-new segment of `l_i'`. By reference data 4 each
segment serves at most one triangle. The 7 original lines carry at most 14
old-new segments in total, so there are **at most 7 triangles of type
{2 original, 1 mirror}**, and by mirror symmetry at most 7 of type
{1 original, 2 mirror}.

**Conclusion.**

    T(mirror-translate family) <= 22 + 7 + 7 = 36

for every choice of the seven directions, every axis, every `D > D0`, split or
clustered. That is 17 below the best known k=14 construction and 18 below the
target. **The family was never a candidate.**

**Cross-check against the agents' own numbers.** In the fully clustered regime
each line has one old-new segment, not two, so the original half carries 7 of
them and the type-{2,1} count drops to `floor(7/2) = 3`, giving `T <= 22+3+3 =
28`. That is exactly T178's mutual-extremality bound of three per side, obtained
here by counting segment types instead of ranking angles. T178's number is
correct; T175's 4 and T177's 4 were reached by a refuted mechanism and are
superseded. T170's demand that 96 of 98 new segments triangulate is refuted
outright: at most 42 of them can be triangle sides in the split case.

## Referee reference data 14: census status, k=13 non-triangular bounded faces

Eleven of nineteen named, all verified by the referee against reference data 6
row by row. Five sigma-fixed (P, F2, F3, F4, F5, reference data 10) and three
sigma-orbits:

    orbit 1   the two free-segment hexagons A and B          (reference data 9)
    orbit 2   G1 = V(2,4)-V(2,9)-V(3,9)-V(3,13)-V(13,10)-V(10,4)
              sigma(G1) on lines {2,5,6,11,12,13}
    orbit 3   H1 = V(2,5)-V(5,12)-V(12,4)-V(4,8)-V(8,11)-V(2,11)
              sigma(H1) on lines {3,4,7,10,11,13}

Ten hexagons and one pentagon so far. **Four orbits, eight faces, remain.**

**The adjacency question the T180 agenda assigned here is now answered, and the
answer needed no census at all.** It asked, for each of the nineteen, how many of
its edges border an unbounded face of B. By reference data 16b the answer is
**zero for seventeen of them, and exactly one each for hexagons A and B**, whose
free segments are the only bounded segments in the arrangement with a
non-triangle on both sides. Agenda item 3 of the T180 agenda is closed. Face size
is likewise irrelevant to the gain (reference data 11a caps every piece at +1).
What the census still owes is the eight unnamed faces themselves, and one of them
in particular: see the agenda.

---

## Referee reference data 15: the T181-T185 candidate, restored and verified

Recovered from turns 181, 183 and 185, which fell out of both agents' context
during the thirty-eight-turn outage. Insert a fourteenth line `l` into
Kabanovitch's B (reference data 6). Row 14, `l`'s own crossing order, is

    14:  1  7  2 13  9  4  6 11  5 10  3 12  8

and the six claimed corner-clips, with both row insertions each:

    clip  face  corner    row/gap                   row/gap
    1     P     V(1,7)    row 1 between 7 and 8     row 7 between 12 and 1
    2     F3    V(2,13)   row 2 between 13 and 8    row 13 between 2 and 7
    3     A     V(9,4)    row 9 between 5 and 4 *   row 4 between 9 and 2
    4     B     V(6,11)   row 6 between 10 and 11 * row 11 between 6 and 13
    5     F5    V(5,10)   row 5 between 7 and 10    row 10 between 8 and 5
    6     F2    V(3,12)   row 3 between 7 and 12    row 12 between 8 and 3

`*` = the free segment itself. Row 8 was never pinned.

**All twelve insertions are correct.** I checked each gap against the printed row
in reference data 6 and against the face's vertex list in reference data 3, 9 and
10: in every case the two named entries are consecutive in the row and the
segment between them is the face's edge on that line. Each clip individually is a
genuine corner clip of a genuine non-triangular face, worth +1 by 11a. What is
wrong with the candidate is the **sequencing**, not the clips. See reference
data 17.

## Referee reference data 16: an inserted line's trajectory is a forced walk

**(a) The segment census.** B has 143 bounded segments and 47 triangles. By
reference data 4 a bounded segment is a side of at most one triangle, so the 141
triangle-sides are 141 distinct segments and exactly 2 carry no triangle at all:
the free segments (`k13-free-segments-forced-by-b-mod-3`, reference data 7).

**(b) The successor lemma.** Let F be one of the nineteen non-triangular bounded
faces of B and `e` an edge of F. Then the face on the far side of `e` is

    a triangle of B                      if e is one of the 141, and
    a 3-sided unbounded wedge            if e is one of the 2 free segments.

It is never another non-triangular bounded face. Proof: `e` is bounded, so it has
two faces; F is not a triangle, so the one triangle `e` may serve is on the far
side; if `e` is free, reference data 8 identifies the far face as the unbounded
wedge spanned by `e` and two rays. Note the corollary the T180 agenda was
reaching for: **exactly two edges in the entire arrangement separate a
non-triangular bounded face from an unbounded one.**

**(c) The walk.** `l`'s fourteen pieces (reference data 11, T159) form a walk

    U_0 , F_1 , F_2 , ... , F_12 , U_13

in the face-adjacency graph of B, where consecutive faces share an edge lying on
the line crossed at that step, the thirteen crossed lines are all distinct, and
`U_0`, `U_13` are unbounded. Then

    Y = # { i : F_i is not a triangle, and F_i's entry and exit edges
                share a vertex }

by 11a (a chord cutting a convex n-gon yields a triangle iff it separates a
single vertex) and 11b (in a triangle the gain is zero). **The successor of a
face is determined by the exit edge. It is not chosen.** This is the fact T181
through T186 did not have.

**(d) The alternation cap, re-proved.** Two consecutive pieces share an edge, so
by (b) no two consecutive pieces are both in non-triangular bounded faces. Hence
`n_N <= 6`, and at `n_N = 6` the six N-chords are a 6-subset of `{1,...,12}` with
no two consecutive: there are `C(7,6) = 7` such subsets.

**(e) Interior spacers are triangles.** If a spacer at position `m` has N-chords
at `m-1` and `m+1`, its face is the far side of both flanking clips' edges, so by
(b) it is a triangle or a free-segment wedge; a wedge has exactly one bounded
edge (reference data 8) so it cannot border two distinct N-faces. Triangle. It
gains 0.

## Referee reference data 17: the T181 chain is impossible

Two lookups in reference data 7.

- P's edge on line 7 is `V(1,7)-V(7,12)` = row 7 positions 10-11 (`12 1`). The
  only triangle that segment can serve is `{1,7,12}`, and `{1,7,12}` **is** in
  reference data 7, with row-1 positions 5-6 (`12 7`) and row-12 positions 8-9
  (`7 1`) confirming all three legs. So the face across P's line-7 edge is the
  triangle `{1,7,12}`.
- F3's edge on line 2 is `V(2,13)-V(2,8)` = row 2 positions 6-7 (`13 8`). The
  only triangle that segment can serve is `{2,8,13}`, which **is** in reference
  data 7, with row-13 positions 5-6 (`8 2`) and row-8 positions 5-6 (`13 2`)
  confirming the other two legs. So the face across F3's line-2 edge is the
  triangle `{2,8,13}`.

Row 14 crosses `1, 7, 2, 13, ...`, so the piece between the line-7 crossing and
the line-2 crossing is simultaneously the face across P's line-7 edge and the
face across F3's line-2 edge. `{1,7,12} != {2,8,13}`. **The chain is dead as
ordered.** The twelve pins survive, the six clips survive individually, the
sequence does not.

## Referee reference data 18: a corner clip does not need a free segment

T229 claimed only a free segment can be corner-clipped, hence a cap of 2. The
failing step is the appeal to 11b. **11b is about a chord lying inside a
triangle.** A clip chord lies inside an *unbounded* face; the triangle sharing
the clipped edge is a different face, entered by a *different* chord of `l`, and
it is that other chord which nets zero.

**Complete worked instance, k=3 to k=4.** B = three lines in general position,
triangle `ABC` with `A = V(1,2)`, `B = V(1,3)`, `C = V(2,3)`, `T(B) = 1`. All
three bounded segments are triangle sides, so B has **no** free segment at all.
Let U be the unbounded face across `AB` from `C`: sides are the segment `AB` on
line 1 and the rays of lines 2 and 3 from `A` and `B`. Insert line 4 crossing
line 2 on its ray at `q`, then line 1 inside `AB` at `p`, then line 3 inside `BC`
at `r`.

    piece            face      result                              gain
    ray                 -      unbounded                            0
    chord q->p          U      clips corner A: triangle {1,2,4}     +1
    chord p->r        ABC      destroys {1,2,3}, creates {1,3,4}     0
    ray                 -      unbounded                            0

`T = 2 = N(4)`, and `N(4) - N(3) = 1 = 1 + 0`. The books close exactly, and the
clipped edge `Ap` is part of `AB`, which already carries triangle `ABC`.
**Freeness is not required and the cap of 2 is false.** What T229 was reaching
for, and what is true, is reference data 19.

## Referee reference data 19: `n_N = 6` forces `Y <= 6` in Kabanovitch's B

Suppose `l` is inserted into B with `n_N = 6` and `Y = 7`. By 16d the six
N-chords are one of seven non-consecutive 6-subsets of `{1,...,12}`; by 16e every
spacer sandwiched between two N-chords is a triangle and gains 0. So the +7 needs
all six N-chords to clip **and** a seventh gain from a spacer that is not
sandwiched. Two shapes of pattern:

**Shape 1, patterns `{1,3,5,7,9,11}` and `{2,4,6,8,10,12}`.** Exactly one spacer
is unsandwiched: position 12 (resp. 1). Reversing `l` if needed, take it to be
12. It must gain, so it is not a triangle, so by 16b the exit edge of the N-clip
at chord 11 is a **free segment**, so chord 11's face is hexagon A or hexagon B
and chord 12's face is wedge A or wedge B. By sigma take A. Then crossing 12 is
line 9 (inside the free segment). Wedge A's edges are the free segment and the
rays of lines 4 and 5, so crossing 13 is line 4 or line 5; hexagon A's line-9
edge is adjacent only to its line-4 edge (at `V(9,4)`) and its line-5 edge (at
`V(5,9)`), so for chord 11 to clip, crossing 11 is line 4 or line 5. Two cases,
and both are the same argument:

    crossing 11 = 4, crossing 13 = 5:
      spacer 10 = far side of A's line-4 edge V(9,4)-V(4,2) = triangle {2,4,9}
        (in reference data 7; row 4 pos 1-2 `9 2`, row 2 pos 2-3 `9 4`,
         row 9 pos 5-6 `4 2`)
      chord 10 exits {2,4,9} on line 4, so it entered on line 2 or 9;
        line 9 is crossing 12, so crossing 10 = line 2
      chord 9 = far side of {2,4,9}'s line-2 edge V(2,9)-V(2,4) = G1
        (reference data 14: G1 = V(2,4)-V(2,9)-V(3,9)-V(3,13)-V(13,10)-V(10,4))
      chord 9 exits G1 on line 2; G1's line-2 edge is adjacent only to its
        line-9 edge and its line-4 edge, so crossing 9 must be line 9 or line 4
      both are already spent, at crossings 12 and 11.        CONTRADICTION

    crossing 11 = 5, crossing 13 = 4:
      spacer 10 = far side of A's line-5 edge V(7,5)-V(5,9) = triangle {5,7,9}
        (row 5 pos 1-2 `9 7`, row 7 pos 2-3 `9 5`, row 9 pos 3-4 `7 5`)
      chord 10 entered on line 7 (line 9 is crossing 12), so crossing 10 = 7
      chord 9 = far side of {5,7,9}'s line-7 edge V(7,9)-V(7,5) = F5
        (reference data 10: F5 = V(5,10)-V(8,10)-V(6,8)-V(6,9)-V(7,9)-V(5,7))
      F5's line-7 edge is adjacent only to its line-9 and line-5 edges, so
        crossing 9 must be line 9 or line 5; both spent.     CONTRADICTION

Wedge B gives the sigma-images of both cases (`sigma: A -> B`,
`{2,4,9} -> {6,11,13}`, `{5,7,9} -> {6,8,10}`, `G1 -> sigma(G1)`, `F5 -> F5`),
which die identically.

**Shape 2, the five middle patterns.** Each has exactly two unsandwiched
spacers and they are **adjacent**, at positions `j, j+1`. Suppose one of them is
unbounded. A wedge's neighbours are its hexagon (across the free segment) and
two unbounded faces (across its rays), so:
 - if spacer `j` is wedge A, spacer `j+1` is unbounded and is reached across a
   ray, so it is not wedge A or B (wedge B shares no line with wedge A's rays);
   but spacer `j+1` must be the far side of the N-clip at `j+2`, hence a triangle
   or a wedge, by 16b. Contradiction.
 - if spacer `j+1` is a wedge, spacer `j` is its neighbour and must be the far
   side of the N-clip at `j-1`, hence a triangle or a wedge; a triangle cannot
   border a wedge (a wedge's only bounded-face neighbour is its hexagon, which is
   not a triangle), and wedges A and B share no edge. Contradiction.

So both spacers are triangles, both gain 0, and `Y <= 6`.

**Conclusion.** `n_N = 6` implies `Y <= 6`. Reaching 54 by inserting a line into
Kabanovitch's optimum therefore requires `n_N <= 5` and **at least two clipping
U-chords**, since `Y <= n_N + n_U` and every clipping U-chord is now known not to
be cheap. Note what this does *not* say: it says nothing about the other k=13
optima, and it is not a proof that `N(14) = 53`. It is one branch, one base.

**Superseded in force by reference data 20**, which reaches "at least four
clipping U-chords" without the pattern enumeration. Kept because its two forced
chains are checked and because agenda item 1 still stands against it.

## Referee reference data 20: the five-block theorem, and why clips are four apart

Everything here is about insertion into Kabanovitch's B (reference data 6), which
is simple, so every vertex lies on exactly two lines. Pieces are `F_0 ... F_13`
with `F_0`, `F_13` unbounded (reference data 11, 16c). A piece **clips** if its
entry and exit edges share a vertex; by 11a it then gains exactly 1, and no other
piece gains anything.

**(a) The forward chain.** Let `F_i` clip at `V(a,b)`, entering on line `a` and
leaving through edge `e` on line `b`, and suppose `e` is a bounded segment that
is not free. Its endpoints are `V(b,a)` and `V(b,c)` for some `c`. Then:

1. `F_{i+1}` is the triangle `{a,b,c}`. By 16b the far side of `e` is a triangle,
   and by reference data 4 the only triangle `e` can serve is `{a,b,c}`.
2. `F_{i+1}` leaves on line `c`. Its sides are on `a`, `b`, `c`; it was entered
   on `b`; `l` crosses `a` exactly once and already did so at the clip's entry
   edge. Forced, and it gains 0 by 11b.
3. `F_{i+2}` is the face across the segment `V(c,a)-V(c,b)`. That segment already
   serves `{a,b,c}` on the near side, so by reference data 4 `F_{i+2}` is **not a
   triangle**; and the two edges of `F_{i+2}` meeting its entry edge do so at
   `V(c,a)` and `V(c,b)`, hence lie on lines `a` and `b`, both spent. So
   **`F_{i+2)` cannot clip**, whether it is bounded or unbounded. Gain 0.

**(b) The backward chain** is the same argument through the entry edge. So a clip
whose two edges are both ordinary bounded segments sits at the centre of

    dud , triangle , CLIP , triangle , dud            gains  0 0 1 0 0

**(c) Every instance in the record is this theorem.** Four hand computations,
each presented as a fact about its own face:

The last row is the correction T251 needs. Its clip is real, and both its edges
are ordinary bounded segments: `V(1,13)-V(1,9)` is row 1 positions 1-2 and
`V(1,9)-V(9,11)` is row 9 positions 9-10, and neither is one of the two free
segments (which are row 9 positions 4-5 and row 6 positions 4-5). Both chains
fire. `{1,9,11}` checks out by the iff test (row 1 pos 2-3 `9 11`, row 9 pos 9-10
`1 11`, row 11 pos 10-11 `1 9`) and is in reference data 7; `{1,9,13}` likewise
(row 1 pos 1-2, row 9 pos 8-9, row 13 pos 11-12). **U1's clip costs five pieces
and four lines, exactly like an N-clip.** "Zero cost" was the wrong unit.

**(d) Two N-clips are at least four apart.** Let `F_i`, `F_j` both clip bounded
non-triangular faces, `i < j`, `g = j - i`.

- `g = 1`: `F_{i+1}` is a triangle (exit non-free) or a wedge (exit free). Either
  way not a bounded non-triangular face.
- `g = 2`: if `i`'s exit is non-free, `F_{i+2}` cannot clip by (a3). If it is
  free, `F_{i+1}` is a wedge, and every face across a wedge's ray is unbounded,
  so `F_{i+2}` is not bounded.
- `g = 3`: with both relevant edges non-free, `F_{i+2}` is a non-triangle by (a3)
  and must be a triangle by (b). If `i`'s exit is free, `F_{i+2}` is unbounded as
  above and cannot be `F_{j-1}`, which must be a triangle or the wedge feeding a
  free entry; and it cannot be the other wedge, since wedges A and B share no
  line (A's edges are on 9, 4, 5; B's on 6, 11, 10) and so are not adjacent. If
  `j`'s entry is free, `F_{j-1}` must be a wedge, but the face across a
  triangle's edge is never a wedge (a wedge's only bounded edge is a free
  segment, whose other side is its hexagon).
- `g = 4` is not excluded: `CLIP, tri, dud, tri, CLIP` is consistent.

**(e) Corollary, and it is the point.** N-clips occupy positions in `{1,...,12}`
pairwise at least 4 apart, so **at most three**. A clip at position 1 or 12
additionally needs a free edge on the outer side, since `F_0` and `F_13` are
unbounded and 16b forbids a non-free edge of an N-face from facing a non-triangle.
Therefore

    Y  =  (N-clips)  +  (clips of unbounded faces)  <=  3  +  n_Uclip

and **`Y = 7` out of Kabanovitch's B requires at least four clipping U-chords.**
Reference data 19 asked for two. The true figure is four, and this derivation
uses neither the seven-pattern enumeration nor `n_N`.

**(f) The only three ways the chain breaks**, which is where any construction has
to live: the edge is **free** (two such segments in the whole arrangement), the
edge is a **ray** (only unbounded faces have those), or the walk **ends**. This
is why reference data 21 matters.

**(g) Scope.** Step (a1) uses 16b, which is a global count specific to B: 143
bounded segments, 141 triangle-sides, two free. The theorem does not transfer to
a base with many free segments. At k=12, 120 bounded segments and 38 triangles
leave six free, the chain breaks six times, and the `Y = 9` realized at
k=12 to 13 is not a counterexample.

## Referee reference data 21: B's unbounded structure, from twenty-six lookups

**(a) Row extremes.** First and last entry of each row of reference data 6:

    line   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13
    first 13  3  2  9  9  7  6  9  8  6  6 13 12
    last   2  1  4  3  6  5  8  7 10  9 12 11  1

`l` crossing line `i` beyond `V(i,first)` or `V(i,last)` is crossing it on a ray.

**(b) Ray vertices.** `V(a,b)` carries a ray of line `a` iff `b` is first or last
in row `a`. Eleven vertices carry rays of **both** their lines:

    V(1,2) V(2,3) V(3,4) V(5,6) V(6,7) V(7,8) V(8,9) V(9,10) V(11,12)
    V(12,13) V(13,1)

Four carry exactly one: `V(4,9)`, `V(5,9)`, `V(6,10)`, `V(6,11)`. That is
`11*2 + 4 = 26` ray endpoints for 26 rays, so the census is closed. The four
single-ray vertices are precisely the four endpoints of the two free segments,
which is the consistency check reference data 8 predicts.

**(c) The slope order is `1, 2, 3, ..., 13` cyclically.** Every unbounded face is
bounded by exactly two rays and they are consecutive at infinity, so the two
lines carrying them are adjacent in the cyclic slope order. The eleven double-ray
vertices give eleven slope-adjacent pairs `{i, i+1}`. Wedge A has rays on lines 4
and 5 and wedge B on lines 10 and 11 (reference data 8, 9), giving `{4,5}` and
`{10,11}`. Those thirteen pairs are exactly the edges of the cycle
`1-2-3-...-13-1`, so they are the complete slope order. It is mirror-consistent:
`sigma: i -> 15-i` reverses that cycle and fixes line 1.

**(d) Eleven corner wedges, and they are the only chain-free gains.** For
`i != 4, 10` the face at `V(i,i+1)` between the two rays is an unbounded wedge
with **no bounded edge at all**. A chord entering on one ray and leaving on the
other clips it for `+1`, and reference data 20 does not fire on either side,
because both edges are rays. These eleven corners are the only gains in this
arrangement that are not five pieces deep. The two exceptional pairs `{4,5}` and
`{10,11}` carry wedges A and B instead, whose single bounded edge is the free
segment: the same two exceptions that break reference data 20's chain, arrived at
from the opposite direction.

**(e) At most six corner-wedge clips.** Each uses both its lines' single
crossings, so the clipped pairs are disjoint: a matching in the eleven-edge graph
`4-3-2-1-13-12-11` plus `5-6-7-8-9-10`, two paths on 7 and 6 vertices, maximum
matching `3 + 3 = 6`.

**(f) The far-line family caps at 53, and this is a complete family kill.** Let
`l` lie entirely outside B's bounded region. It crosses the thirteen lines in
slope order, so its fourteen pieces occupy fourteen consecutive gaps at infinity
and its twelve chords occupy the twelve strictly interior ones. A chord gains
iff its gap is a corner wedge. **No two gaps that are consecutive at infinity are
both corner wedges:** they share a ray, and a shared ray has one finite endpoint,
so the two corners would have to be the same vertex. Twelve consecutive gaps with
no two adjacent chosen give at most six. Hence

    T(far line into Kabanovitch's B)  <=  47 + 6  =  53

for every direction and every distance. Note what this explains: 53 is the record
at k=14, and the crudest possible insertion already reaches it or one short of
it. Note also what it forbids: no line outside the bounded region can ever give
54, so any 54 must send `l` through the interior, where reference data 20 fires.

**(g) One bit I could not pin, and it is a good next lookup.** Going around the
26 gaps, consecutive corner wedges automatically alternate between the two
antipodal halves, because a line's two rays are opposite. That fixes the pattern
within each run of consecutive corners and across the wrap at line 1, giving
pairs `{1,2}`, `{3,4}`, `{12,13}` in one half and `{2,3}`, `{11,12}`, `{13,1}` in
the other. The run `{5,6}, {6,7}, {7,8}, {8,9}, {9,10}` is separated from the
rest by the two exceptional pairs, so **its half is not determined by the
extremes alone**. If it lands with the first group, a far line achieves the full
six and reconstructs a 53-triangle 14-line arrangement by hand; if not, five.

## Table

| slug | k | status | evidence | opened | last touched |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `five-block-theorem` | 13/14 | **SETTLED (referee), UNATTACKED** | Reference data 20a-c. A clip at `V(a,b)` whose exit edge on line `b` is a bounded non-free segment forces the next piece to the triangle `{a,b,c}`, forces its exit to line `c`, and forces the piece after that to be a non-triangle that cannot clip because its entry edge's two neighbours lie on the spent lines `a` and `b`. Same backwards. Five pieces, one gain. Reproduces T231, T245, T249, T254 and reference data 19's chain as instances. Mine, unattacked, scope-limited to B by 20g. | T255 | T255 |
| `n-clips-are-four-apart-at-most-three` | 13/14 | **SETTLED (referee), UNATTACKED** | Reference data 20d-e. Gaps of 1, 2 and 3 between two clips of bounded non-triangular faces all contradict, including through a free segment, using that wedges A and B share no line. Twelve chord positions, minimum gap 4, so at most three N-clips; a clip at position 1 or 12 additionally needs a free outer edge. | T255 | T255 |
| `y7-needs-four-clipping-u-chords` | 13/14 | **SETTLED (referee), UNATTACKED** | Immediate from the row above: `Y <= 3 + n_Uclip`. Supersedes reference data 19's "at least two" and is independent of it, of `n_N`, and of the seven-pattern enumeration. **This is now the live target: four corner clips of unbounded faces on one straight line, plus at most three interior clips, on thirteen crossings.** | T255 | T255 |
| `kabanovitch-slope-order-is-1-to-13-cyclic` | 13 | **SETTLED (referee)** | Reference data 21a-c. Twenty-six lookups (first and last entry of each row) give eleven double-ray vertices `V(i,i+1)`; wedges A and B supply the pairs `{4,5}` and `{10,11}`; the thirteen pairs are exactly the cycle `1-2-...-13-1`. Sigma reverses it and fixes line 1, as a mirror must. | T255 | T255 |
| `eleven-corner-wedges-are-the-only-chain-free-gains` | 13 | **SETTLED (referee), UNATTACKED** | Reference data 21d-e. At `V(i,i+1)` for `i != 4, 10` the outer face is a wedge with two rays and no bounded edge; clipping it gains 1 and reference data 20 cannot fire, since the chain needs bounded edges to propagate. Disjointness of line pairs caps corner-wedge clips at 6 by a matching argument on two paths. | T255 | T255 |
| `far-line-family-capped-at-53` | 14 | **SETTLED (referee)** | Reference data 21f. A line outside B's bounded region crosses in slope order and gains exactly its corner wedges; no two gaps consecutive at infinity are both corner wedges, so a twelve-gap window yields at most six. `47 + 6 = 53`. **Any 54 must route `l` through the interior.** This is the crude family cap the standing rule demands, produced before any fine structure. | T255 | T255 |
| `u1-clip-at-v1-9-exists` | 13/14 | **SETTLED (referee-verified)** | T250 found the extremal segment, T251 built the clip, T252 conceded it by re-deriving the sector decomposition. I re-derived it independently: `V(1,13)` is a double-ray vertex, the sector `[line1-seg, line13-ray]` is unbounded, and at `V(1,9)` its two edges `V(1,13)-V(1,9)` and `V(1,9)-V(9,11)` are consecutive sides of one convex face. First fully specified clipping U-chord in the project. | T250 | T255 |
| `u1-clip-costs-zero` | 13/14 | **REFUTED (referee)** | T251's pricing. Reference data 20c: both of U1's clip edges are ordinary bounded segments, so the chain fires both ways, forcing triangles `{1,9,11}` and `{1,9,13}` and two duds beyond them. Five pieces, four lines, one gain. The error is the unit: the budget is twelve chords, not five N-slots. Do not cite "zero cost". | T251 | T255 |
| `walk-has-no-intrinsic-direction` | all | **SETTLED (SILVER)** | T252 claimed U1 "already decided" line 9's predecessor and that no other piece could have line 9 as a successor. T253 refuted it: `l` has no orientation until one is chosen, and a shared crossing between consecutive pieces is how the walk chains, not a collision. T254 conceded by re-deriving the shared-crossing mechanism. Recorded disagreement, evidence-gated concession, falsifiable statement. **Fourth silver.** | T252 | T255 |
| `two-corners-of-one-vertex-cannot-both-be-clipped` | 13 | **SETTLED** | T232, conceded with re-derivation T233. F4 and F5 both have a corner at `V(5,10)`; `l` crosses line 5 once and line 10 once, so there is exactly one chord with those endpoints and it lies in one sector. Clean, general, and the first correct use of the single-crossing invariant this cycle. | T232 | T255 |
| `segment-exclusivity-invariant` | all | **SETTLED** | T246 named it: each line meets `l` once, so at most one segment of that line is ever an edge the walk touches, and two distinct segments of the same line sharing only a vertex cannot both be used. Used correctly by T237, T242, T243, T244, T246. It is the engine inside reference data 20 and it deserved its own name earlier. | T246 | T255 |
| `p-f2-excluded-in-complete-generality` | 13 | **REFUTED (T241, T243)** | T240's headline, asserted from two of P's five corners with the other three flagged unchecked in the same turn. T241 did `V(12,3)`, T243 did `V(7,12)` and `V(3,8)`: the last two tax only one of lines 7, 8. The narrower true claim is the row below. Do not cite the general form. | T240 | T255 |
| `p-clip-is-a-four-line-object` | 13 | **SETTLED** | T237-T243, and now an instance of reference data 20. Clipping P at `V(1,7)`, `V(8,1)` or `V(12,3)` consumes lines 7 and 8 together via the fixed triangle `{1,7,8}`; clipping at `V(7,12)` consumes `{1,3,7,12}` and at `V(3,8)` consumes `{1,3,8,12}`. All five corners now computed, and the two chains at `V(7,12)` and `V(3,8)` are sigma-images, which cross-checks them. | T237 | T255 |
| `hex-a-wedge-a-paired-clip-dead` | 13/14 | **SETTLED** | T231, and correct: clipping hexagon A on the way into wedge A forces `{2,4,9}` or `{5,7,9}` and then G1 or F5, which needs a spent line. T231 was right that this does not need reference data 19's enumeration. It is the backward half of reference data 20 applied to A's line-4 and line-5 edges. | T231 | T255 |
| `interior-clips-cost-two-n-slots-for-one-gain` | 13 | **SETTLED, and generalized** | T245 (F4 forces F5), T249 (P forces F2), T254 (the F4 chain traced end to end and F5's entry pinned to line 10). All three are correct and all three are reference data 20a3 with the dud landing on a bounded face. The general statement is that the dud gains 0 whether bounded or unbounded, so the cost is a piece, not specifically an N-slot. | T245 | T255 |
| `z-face-is-unbounded` | 13 | **SETTLED (referee-verified)** | T248. `V(7,8)` is where row 7 and row 8 each end, so both lines have rays there; Z is the sector between line 7's inward edge and line 8's ray, hence unbounded. Confirmed independently by reference data 21b, where `V(7,8)` appears in the double-ray census. T248 also gave the right general reason Z is not a triangle: a segment's endpoints fix the only triple it can serve, and that triple is already used on the other side. | T248 | T255 |
| `n-face-edges-carry-triangles-except-free-segments` | 13 | **SETTLED (referee)** | Reference data 16b. 143 bounded segments, 141 triangle-sides, 2 free; a non-triangular bounded face is never on the triangle side, so every edge of the nineteen has a triangle across it except the two free segments, which have unbounded wedges. Answers the T180 agenda's adjacency question outright: 17 of the 19 faces border no unbounded face at all, hexagons A and B border exactly one each. | T230 | T230 |
| `insertion-trajectory-is-a-forced-walk` | all | **SETTLED (referee)** | Reference data 16. `l`'s 14 pieces are a walk in B's face-adjacency graph with 13 distinct line labels; `Y` counts pieces whose entry and exit edges share a vertex and whose face is not a triangle; **the successor face is determined by the exit edge**. Replaces the chord-typing frame of reference data 11 with something that constrains. | T230 | T230 |
| `n-N-6-forces-Y-at-most-6-in-kabanovitch` | 13/14 | **SETTLED (referee), UNATTACKED** | Reference data 19. Seven position patterns, interior spacers forced to triangles, the only clipping U-chord terminal, then the forced chain wedge A -> `{2,4,9}` or `{5,7,9}` -> G1 or F5 needs a line already spent. Mirror cases by sigma. **Consequence: 54 from Kabanovitch's B needs `n_N <= 5` and two clipping U-chords.** Flagged UNATTACKED because it is the referee's own argument and no agent has had a turn on it. Not a proof that `N(14) = 53`. **Still unattacked after a full cycle in which agenda item 1 told both agents to break it.** T231 generalized its Shape-1 chain correctly instead. Its core step is now a special case of reference data 20, derived independently, which is the closest thing to a check it has had. | T230 | T255 |
| `t181-six-clip-chain-as-ordered` | 14 | **DEAD (refuted by referee)** | Reference data 17. The spacer between the P-clip and the F3-clip must be triangle `{1,7,12}` and triangle `{2,8,13}` at once. Checked in T184, T185 and T186 and missed in all three. | T181 | T230 |
| `t181-t185-twelve-row-insertions-correct` | 14 | **SETTLED (referee-verified)** | Reference data 15. All twelve two-row pins for the six corner-clips check out against reference data 6 and the face vertex lists. The clips are individually genuine; only the sequencing fails. Recovered from turns 181-185 after the outage dropped them from both agents' context. | T183 | T230 |
| `corner-clip-requires-a-free-segment` | all | **REFUTED (referee)** | Reference data 18. T229's cap of 2. Misreads 11b, which governs a chord **inside** a triangle, as governing a chord in an unbounded face bordering one. The k=3 to k=4 instance has zero free segments, clips an edge that already carries a triangle, gains +1, and the arithmetic closes exactly. Fourth misuse of reference data 4's standing caution. Do not cite. | T229 | T230 |
| `free-segment-wedge-clip-gains-one` | 13/14 | **SETTLED** | T228's mechanism is correct: enter wedge A across the free segment, leave across a ray meeting its far endpoint, +1. Reference data 19 shows it is not one option among many but the forced final step of the `n_N = 6` branch, and that the branch then dies two steps upstream. Right move, wrong reason, dead end. | T228 | T230 |
| `sigma-fixed-face-line-set-is-sigma-invariant` | 13 | **SETTLED (referee-verified)** | T226. A sigma-fixed face's supporting-line set is sigma-invariant, and `sigma(7) = 8`, so it contains both 7 and 8 or neither. Verified on P, F2, F3, F4, F5. Referee addition: the set is a union of sigma-orbits, so `|S|` is even unless line 1 bounds the face, which is exactly why P is the only odd fixed face. Retrodictive, not predictive; the census was already closed. | T226 | T230 |
| `line-7-8-corridor-is-a-density-artifact` | 13 | **SETTLED (SILVER)** | T226 claimed lines 7 and 8 border 7 of 11 named faces so the corridor is the dense target. T227 subtracted the five sigma-fixed faces, which the same turn's own lemma forces to contain both lines, and the count collapses to 2 of 6 each, an even split. T228 conceded by re-deriving the double-count and dropped the inference while keeping the lemma. Recorded disagreement, evidence-gated concession, falsifiable claim. **Third silver in the ledger.** | T226 | T230 |
| `iff-test-cannot-validate-a-table` | all | **SETTLED (referee)** | The reference data 2 test says which triples are triangular **given** a valid arrangement table. Six locally-true triples were checked across T184, T185 and T186 and the table they sat in does not exist. State it once here so it is never used as a table certificate again. | T230 | T230 |
| `corner-clip-cannot-reuse-a-crossing` | 14 | **SETTLED** | T187. `{14,8,12}` would need line 14 adjacent to 8 on the far side of the crossing V(14,12) that the F2 clip already spends. One crossing, one position, two sides, one of them already taken. Reference data 4 applied at a vertex, and the first correct use of that rule in the thread. | T187 | T230 |
| `mirror-translate-family-capped-at-36` | 14 | **SETTLED (referee)** | Reference data 13. Segment-type count on a single line, no angles, no D, no order type. `T <= 22 + 7 + 7 = 36` for the entire distant-mirror family; `T <= 28` in the clustered regime, reproducing T178. Kills T170's 96-of-98 saturation demand, T171's "compute the stable order type", and the whole of T173-T179 as a line of inquiry. | T180 | T180 |
| `insertion-gain-ratio-refutes-y-bound-program` | all | **SETTLED (referee)** | Reference data 12. `N(13) - N(12) = 9` from 11 chords; `N(15) - N(14) >= 11` from 13 chords; ratios of 0.78 to 0.86 across k=9, 11, 13. The 7-from-12 that k=14 needs is a ratio of 0.58, milder than three closed cases already realize. **Agenda item 2 of the owner override is dead.** Bounding Y below 7 is not a plausible target and was never checked against KNOWN.md before being promoted. | T180 | T180 |
| `insertion-leak-is-u-chords-not-rays` | all | **SETTLED (referee)** | Reference data 11. Rays gain exactly 0 (recession-cone argument, needs only no-parallels). Every piece gains at most 1 (the `a+3`/`b+3` split). The leak in T163's partition is bounded chords lying in **unbounded** faces. The k=4 to k=5 case pins it: 3 chords, 1 non-triangular bounded face, gain 3, so at least 2 chords sit in unbounded wedges and all 3 gain. The owner correction reached the right verdict by the wrong route; this replaces it. | T180 | T180 |
| `insertion-y-capped-at-6-independent-of-concurrence-count` | 13/14 | **REFUTED (owner T170, referee-confirmed T180)** | T167's `Y <= (n+m+1)/2 = 6.5`. Algebra right, partition wrong. See reference data 11d. Do not cite. | T167 | T180 |
| `generic-insertion-into-any-simple-13-line-caps-53` | 13/14 | **REFUTED (owner T170, referee-confirmed T180)** | T168's generalization inherits the same omission. Reference data 12 now also shows it is false in spirit: the insertion gain at k=12 -> 13 is already 9. | T168 | T180 |
| `no-two-nontriangular-faces-share-an-edge` | 13 | **SETTLED as stated, MISUSED twice downstream** | The literal claim is true and is Tamura's per-segment argument. What does not follow is any cap on Y, because the chord classes are not exhaustive. Misused at T163 and again at T177 under the name "segment supply". Keep the fact, never the corollary. | T163 | T180 |
| `unbounded-wedge-clip-creates-bounded-triangle` | all | **SETTLED (referee)** | Reference data 11d, 11e and now 18, which supplies a complete worked k=3 -> k=4 instance with the gains tallied piece by piece. It is a chord phenomenon, it does not need a free segment, and it is the only source of a seventh triangle once reference data 19 caps the N-clips. | T170 | T230 |
| `two-clipping-u-chords-needed` | 13/14 | **SUPERSEDED by `y7-needs-four-clipping-u-chords`** | The old framing asked whether one line can make two clipping U-chords alongside five N-clips. The count is four, not two, and the N-clip side is capped at three, not five. The remark that a bare U-chord is worthless is now sharpened: a line missing the bounded region entirely gains at most six and its gains are exactly corner wedges (reference data 21f). | T180 | T255 |
| `same-quadrant-mirror-forces-single-hinge` | 14 | **SETTLED (SILVER)** | T175 proposed it in the eps -> 0 narrow-band limit; T176 conceded against its own prior and **strengthened** it with the exact derivative `g'(theta_j) = -cos(theta_i)/sin^2(theta_i+theta_j)`, valid for any seven directions in a common quadrant, no limit needed. I re-derived the quotient rule and it is right: on a common quadrant `theta_i + theta_j` never reaches a pole, so `g` is strictly decreasing throughout and the nearest new crossing on every original line is the same mirror line. Genuine forced convergence, evidence-gated, on a falsifiable statement. **Second silver in the ledger.** Its value is bounded by reference data 13: it is a sharp result about a family that dies to a cruder count. | T175 | T180 |
| `mirror-hinge-ranking-has-a-moving-pole` | 14 | **CONTESTED (referee correction of T179)** | `g_i(theta_j) = cos(theta_j)/sin(theta_i+theta_j)` has a pole at `theta_j = 180 - theta_i` that moves with i; across it `g` jumps from `-inf` to `+inf`. T176 said so explicitly; T179's "at most two monotonicity regimes, hence at most two distinct hinge values" drops that clause without argument and does not follow. Moot under reference data 13, recorded so the reasoning error is not inherited. | T179 | T180 |
| `mixed-triangle-segment-supply-cap` | 14 | **DEAD (refuted T178, withdrawn T179)** | T177's "a claimed Tamura segment cannot serve as `V(i,i')` for a new mixed triangle". T178's refutation is correct: Tamura's rule constrains one side of a segment in one arrangement and says nothing about a different triangle in a larger arrangement. T179 withdrew with a correct re-derivation. Superseded in any case by reference data 13, which reaches a stronger bound without it. | T177 | T180 |
| `distant-axis-preserves-same-side-triangles` | 14 | **SETTLED** | T170's limit argument, re-derived independently at T171 with the explicit affine `t(D) = a + bD`. Referee-checked: the crossing parameter along `l_i` has leading term `D cos(theta_j)/sin(theta_i+theta_j)`, which diverges whenever `sin(theta_i+theta_j) != 0`. Finite intersection of 49 eventually-true conditions gives one `D0`. This is the one durable result of the mirror stretch, and reference data 13 is built on it. | T170 | T180 |
| `mirror-translate-involution-phi` | 14 | **SETTLED** | T172, re-derived T173. `phi = T_v after R` with `v` along the axis normal satisfies `phi^2 = id`, swaps the two sevens, fixes no line, so no triangle is phi-fixed and every triangle sits in an orbit of 2. Correct and now decorative. | T172 | T180 |
| `mirror-line-new-point-split-forced-by-critical-direction` | 14 | **SETTLED, then answered** | T173 showed the divergence sign can differ across mirror lines, splitting a line's new crossings across both ends. T174 answered it with an explicit shear-into-a-narrow-band recipe, conceded T175. Both are right; reference data 13 shows the split case caps at 36 and the clustered case at 28, so the distinction never mattered. | T173 | T180 |
| `straight-insertion-visits-distinct-faces-by-convexity` | all | **SETTLED** | T159, conceded with re-derivation T160. A line meets a convex region's boundary at most twice, so `l`'s 14 pieces lie in 14 distinct faces of B. Load-bearing in reference data 11. The T160 gate stamp of UNGROUNDED_CONCESSION on that turn is a gate error; the turn does re-derive. | T159 | T180 |
| `k13-axis-face-census-complete` | 13 | **SETTLED (referee-verified edge by edge)** | Reference data 10 and 14. T156 gave F2 and F3, T157 gave F4 and F5, and all five sigma-fixed faces sit on the axis in the predicted order. I checked all 30 cited row adjacencies against reference data 6 and every one holds. Agenda item 1 of the T155 agenda is closed and was closed correctly. | T156 | T180 |
| `k13-orbit-faces-g1-h1-and-images` | 13 | **SETTLED (referee-verified)** | T158's G1, T159's `sigma(G1)`, T160's H1, T161's `sigma(H1)`. All twelve of G1's and H1's cited row adjacencies check out. Eleven of nineteen named; four orbits remain. | T158 | T180 |
| `triangle-list-resolves-sector-ambiguity-without-side-rule` | 13 | **SETTLED** | T156's tool: at a walk vertex, test the candidate triple against reference data 7's list of 47; a genuine triangle occupies a known sector, so the exit edge is pinned. Equivalent in strength to reference data 8 and cheaper. It is what made T156-T162 fast. | T156 | T180 |
| `folding-back-is-discovery-redundancy-not-target-shrinkage` | 13 | **SETTLED** | T162, conceded with re-derivation at T163. A hexagon has six sides so six of the 141 triangle-side seeds point at it; two walks landing on the same face is what redundancy predicts. Correctly kills T161's inference. | T162 | T180 |
| `extreme-concurrence-yields-no-chord-not-a-gain` | 13/14 | **SETTLED** | T165, sharpened T166 into zero credit rather than reduced credit, via the argument that a bounded face cannot contain an unbounded ray with no earlier crossing. Independent of the refuted cap and survives it. | T165 | T170 |
| `face-walk-side-test-is-two-lookups` | all | **SETTLED (referee)** | Reference data 8. Two agents declared the method blocked at T153-T154 on the turn before it would have worked. | T153 | T155 |
| `k13-free-segment-outer-face-is-unbounded` | 13 | **SETTLED** | Reference data 8. Each free segment contributes one of the nineteen, not two. | T153 | T155 |

| `k13-fixed-pentagon-on-line-1` | 13 | **SETTLED (referee)** | Reference data 10. | T155 | T155 |
| `perfect-extremal-score-equivalent-to-zero-slack` | 14 | **SETTLED (self-reversal resolved at T154)** | Not silver: no opponent forced it. | T137 | T155 |
| `zero-slack-forbids-mutual-extremal-failure` | 14 | **DEAD (true but not a shortcut)** | Usable as a filter on a candidate table, nothing more. | T108 | T155 |
| `suzuki-deletion-route-fully-exhausted` | 15/14 | **SETTLED (computed twice, second run defective)** | `R_l = 0` for all fifteen l. T145 and T151 each mislabelled a candidate; referee ran both missing checks. Result stands, second run does not establish it. | T119 | T152 |
| `two-leg-near-miss-is-a-counting-artifact` | 15 | **DEAD (refuted by referee)** | The leg that held in each case is the one the deletion creates by definition. | T135 | T152 |
| `k13-second-free-segment-is-line6-row-positions-4-5` | 13 | **SETTLED (referee)** | Reference data 7. | T152 | T152 |
| `k13-complete-47-triangle-enumeration` | 13 | **SETTLED (referee)** | Reference data 7, cross-checked three ways. | T152 | T152 |
| `k13-mirror-automorphism` | 13 | **SETTLED (referee)** | Verified on all thirteen rows. It has now paid five times: free segments, triangle orbits, the fixed-face census, `sigma(G1)` and `sigma(H1)`. The single most productive structural fact in the project. | T152 | T180 |
| `k13-free-segments-forced-by-b-mod-3` | 13 | **SETTLED (SILVER)** | T140, conceded by re-derivation T141, referee-verified. `143 mod 3 = 2`. At k=14, p=3, `162 mod 3 = 0`, so a 54-triangle arrangement has zero free segments. | T140 | T152 |
| `parallel-pair-adjacency-forced-free-mechanism-cleared-in-bader` | 14 | **SETTLED** | T143, all 36 combinations checked. | T143 | T152 |
| `p3-forces-per-line-tiered-saturation-12-or-11` | 14 | **SETTLED** | T131, re-derived T132. `8(12) + 6(11) = 162`. | T131 | T152 |
| `v11-12-is-the-single-unresolved-mutual-extremal-vertex` | 14 | SETTLED (not new) | Already in reference data 5 since T127. | T147 | T152 |
| `deletion-from-a-known-optimum-needs-R` | all | **DEAD (parked with reason)** | `T' = T - deg_T(l) + R_l` stays; the construction route on it does not. Note reference data 12 uses the same identity in the other direction and gets a live result out of it. | T119 | T180 |
| `deletion-identity-is-T-minus-deg-plus-R` | 14/15 | **SETTLED (referee)** | R is not always zero; T121's proof miscounted a merged face's sides by one. | T119 | T127 |
| `insertion-into-k13-needs-seven-corner-clips` | 13/14 | **CONTESTED, and now mostly closed** | `T' = T(B) + Y`; reaching 54 from 47 needs `Y = 7` from 12 bounded chords. Reference data 12 still says 7/12 is unremarkable next to the 9/11 realized at k=12 -> 13, so the route is not dead. But of the seven gains, at most three can come from bounded non-triangular faces (reference data 20e), and the six turns T243-T254 spent pricing interior clips found every one of them costing five pieces. The remaining four must be corner clips of unbounded faces, and the only ones that are not themselves five pieces deep are the eleven corner wedges of reference data 21d. | T125 | T255 |
| `tamura-tight-implies-every-line-saturated` | all | **SETTLED (referee)** | Suzuki's k=15 is degree-regular at 13 as a theorem. | T127 | T127 |

| `bader-triangle-adjacency-test-is-iff` | 14 | **SETTLED** | T94 proposed, T95 proved sufficiency, referee supplied necessity. Still the most productive claim in the ledger. | T94 | T152 |
| `mutual-extremal-vertex-tv-leq-1-general` | all | **SETTLED** | T106. Extremality at a vertex is a statement about which sectors escape. | T106 | T155 |

| `signotope-vs-chirotope-5-element-gate` | all | SETTLED, **and now a banned incantation** | T114. Any table surgery owes the rank-3 exchange axiom, then stretchability. 229 turns, zero invocations. It was nominated as "the concrete next step" at T182, T184, T186 and twice more, including at moments when a two-lookup argument (reference data 17) settled the same question. **Do not name it as a next step again unless you run one in the same turn or explain why it cannot be run by hand.** | T114 | T230 |

| `k14-54-reachable` | 14 | **CONTESTED** | The actual question. 254 turns, zero verifier runs (tool unavailable, referee-confirmed again this cycle), zero 14-line arrangements built. Two things moved this cycle, both mine and both unattacked: reference data 20 caps interior clips at three, so 54 from Kabanovitch's B needs four corner clips of unbounded faces; reference data 21f kills the entire exterior-line family at 53. Together they say a 54 must thread the interior four times and clip on the way through each time. That is a much more specific object than anything the project has had, and it is still an object nobody has exhibited or excluded. CONTESTED, prior unmoved. | T1 | T255 |
